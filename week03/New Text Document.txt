To complete this assignment, follow the steps below and create a Word document that includes all the necessary components. Here's a breakdown of the tasks and what to include in your document:

### 1. **Logo**
   - **Choose or design a logo**: Select a logo for your rafting website. You can choose from the provided logos or create your own.
   - **Insert the logo image** into your Word document: Add the image of your chosen logo into the Word document.
   
   Example: If you select a logo, you can insert it by going to the **Insert** tab in Word and choosing **Pictures** to upload the logo file.

### 2. **Color Palette**
   - **Choose a color palette**: Use [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co) to generate a color palette that fits the theme of your rafting site. You can choose 3–4 colors that complement each other and the overall theme.
   
   After selecting your palette, note down the **hex codes** for the colors. The hex code is a six-digit number starting with `#`, e.g., `#ff5733`.
   
   **Record the following color labels with their hex codes**:
   - **primary-color** ____________
   - **secondary-color** _____________
   - **accent1-color** _____________
   - **accent2-color** _____________

   Example color codes:
   - **primary-color** #1a73e8
   - **secondary-color** #34a853
   - **accent1-color** #fbbc05
   - **accent2-color** #ea4335

   **Provide the link to your Coolors palette**:
   - In Coolors, you’ll see a URL in the address bar that links directly to your created palette. Copy that URL and paste it into the document.
   - Example: `https://coolors.co/f2d7ee-d3bcc0-a5668b-69306d-0e103d`

### 3. **Typography**
   - **Choose two fonts from Google Fonts** for your website:
     - One for the **headings** (e.g., something bold and impactful).
     - One for the **body text** (e.g., something readable and clean).

   You can use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to browse and select your fonts. After selecting, note down the names of the fonts.

   Example:
   - **heading-font**: `Roboto Slab`
   - **text-font**: `Open Sans`
