    <h2>W03 Project: Rafting Site – Planning Document</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Developing a site plan is a critical step in any web design and development project. Site
      plans help establish the purpose of the site, the targeted message, and the overall look and
      feel. The plan provides a framework to apply consistently across a site's pages. It is a
      blueprint from which to design and develop.</p>

    <div class="callout info">
      <p>
        Typically you will heavily involve stakeholders or clients in the
        planning process as you ask questions and develop scenarios which target a specific audience
        and meet the website's objectives.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Prepare</h3>
    <h4>Site Plan Outline</h4>

    <p>Site plans come in many shapes and sizes and in varying levels of detail. Here is a list of
      common elements in a site plan.</p>
    <ul class="check" style="margin-left:40px;">
      <li>Statement of purpose and goals</li>
      <li>Definition of the target audience</li>
      <li>Personas and scenarios (who will use the site and how will they use it?)</li>
      <li>A style guide
        <ul>
          <li>Branding Information (how to correctly use the branding for the site)</li>
          <li>Typography choices and justification</li>
          <li>Color palette</li>
          <li>Specific styling of elements on the site (headings, lists, paragraphs, forms, links,
            buttons, and so
            on)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A site map</li>
      <li>Wireframes showing general layout and content areas for major pages</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Purpose Statement</h4>
    <p>From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying content. This is the underlying purpose behind
      every site on the Internet, or at least it should be. In order to determine which content or functionality you
      should put on the site, it is critical to determine the site's purpose. The content should support
      that purpose. At a high level these purposes can take many forms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Build revenue</strong> for a new or existing business</li>
      <li><strong>Share information</strong> for business or educational purposes</li>
      <li><strong>Share opinions</strong> on a subject</li>
      <li><strong>Share personal interests</strong> with family and friends</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All websites should have a purpose, and that purpose should be more than "My teacher is
      making me do this". The purpose needs to be defined by the client and stakeholders and not the
      site developer. For this course's whitewater rafting project, you will need to imagine that you are the
      owner of the rafting business and have decided that it is time to have an online presence.</p>

    <h4>Target Audience Statement</h4>
    <p>Websites are all about content. The site's purpose helps define what content you should include, and
      the content should target your specific audience or audiences (websites can have more than
      audience). Some questions and scenarios that can help drive decisions about site content include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation, such as their age, financial
        situation, interests, etc.</li>
      <li>What do they want?</li>
      <li>What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by them accessing the website?</li>
      <li>What are their needs that aren't being met?</li>
      <li>How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)?</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>The Style Guide</h4>
    <h5>Color Palette</h5>
    <p>Color plays an essential role in any website, and so you will choose the colors deliberately. The following video
      will teach you some lessons about color theory and can help you with your color choices.</p>
    <p>Video: ▶️ <a href="https://youtu.be/_2LLXnUdUIc" target="_blank">Beginning Graphic Design: Color</a></p>

    <p>Using the <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">coolors.co</a> tool, explore the five
      color palettes stripes. When you hover ovr a color the following four items appear:
      Alternative Shades, Drag, Adjust, and Lock. Play around with one color until you end up with
      something you like. You will use this tool to choose the color schema of your rafting project
      this week. You can hit the space bar on your keyboard to generate different complementary
      color schemes for the color you chose. Feel free to lock other colors and generate until you
      end up with 3 to 4 colors that you wish to use on your rafting site.</p>

    <h5>Fonts / Typography</h5>
    <p>After the colors you choose, fonts have the next largest (or even larger in some cases) impact on a site's look
      and feel. The following video shares some important lessons about fonts.</p>
    <p>Watch: ▶️ <a href="https://youtu.be/sByzHoiYFX0" target="_blank">Beginning Graphic Design: Typography</a></p>
    <p>Read: <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/css/css-fonts/prepare1/">CSS Fonts</a> –
      This
      article provides a video demonstration of applying CSS font declarations and an example of how to use Google
      Fonts.</p>

    <h5>Example Style Guide</h5>
    <p>Open the <strong>FamilySearch</strong> style guide example to get a better idea about how a site plan might be
      put together.
    </p><div class="callout info smaller">
      <p>Note: the FamilySearch style guide is not exactly a site plan, but it does have similar purposes and content to
        the site plan that you will create in this
        class.</p>

    <h4>A Site Map</h4>
    <p>The site map provides a graphic view of the hierarchy, navigation, and relationship between the pages on a
      website. The site map is typically a sketch of all the pages and references on the site and is
      derived from the customer's functional specifications. The hierarchical relationship is
      illustrated and will drive the site navigation and links. Depending on the project, these site
      maps can be complex. Given the relatively small size of this course's rafting site project, you will likely not
      draw up a site map.</p>

    <div class="callout warning">
      <p>Do not confuse the visual site map section of the website planning document with a XML sitemap file that lists
        a website's URLs for search engines like Google, Bing, etc., to help them crawl and index the website's pages
        more efficiently.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Wireframes</h4>
    <p>The wireframe shows what the home page will look like, or in other words, how it will be laid
      out. The rafting site home page wireframe will be provided to you and the home page will be
      built using that prescribed layout.</p>


    <h3>Activity Instructions</h3>
    <p>Consider the purpose and audience of the FamilySearch site. Ponder the following questions
      and statements about the FamilySearch site.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Do you think the current <a href="https://design4users.com/hero-images-in-web-design/" target="_blank">hero
          image</a> used on the main page of <a href="https://familysearch.org/" target="_blank">FamilySearch</a> is
        effective or not? Why?
      </li>
      <li>Does the site accomplish the purpose well and cater to its audience?</li>
      <li>Consider the main menu. Why were these topics and words selected for the main menu? Are there any sub-menu
        items that are phrased as questions?</li>
      <li>In the <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/frontier/styleguide/" target="_blank">FamilySearch<sup>TM</sup>
          Style
          Guide</a>, select the <strong>Colors</strong> menu and review the
        <strong>Logo Colors</strong>. Compare these colors with the FamilySearch Logo and note the
        application. Do you have any <a href="https://contrast-ratio.com/" target="_blank">color
          contrast</a> concerns?<br>

      </li>
      <li>In the FamilySearch Style Guide, select the <strong>Typography</strong> menu (left hand
        side of page) and read through the directives of use and avoidance. What is the accessibility purpose of
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#usage_notes" target="_blank">HTML headings</a><em>(see Usage Notes)</em>?
      </li>
    </ol>
